在前传中我们提到过雅各并非是那一段故事的主角，以扫才是，也提到过这突出了拣选的教义。但圣经中以扫的出现单单是如此目的吗？以扫虽然有轻看神，但他仍然是一个非常优秀的人，我们几乎看不到他其它的缺点：他孝敬父母，勤劳，实干，打猎功夫一流，虽然不善交际口无遮拦但内心宽厚，是一个豪爽的汉子，在仆人中也似乎很有威信。更重要的是，雅各手和脖子上蒙上了羊羔皮，然后穿上以扫的衣服，而以撒正是闻到衣服上以扫的香气、摸到“以扫的手”才给雅各祝福的，这与我们披戴基督来到上帝面前是如此的相似，难道这仅仅是巧合吗？若不是巧合，以扫是基督的预表？

为了不轻率的下结论，我们需要跳出以扫这一具体的人物，从更广的视角来寻求答案。以扫是长子，他被弃绝，而次子蒙拣选——这一模式并非单单发生在以扫身上，长幼次序调换的还有：该隐-亚伯、以实玛利-以撒、谢拉-法勒斯、玛拿西-以法莲。神为什么这样安排呢？圣经直接论述到这些的经文不多，略有启发性的是保罗对以实玛利-以撒的解读：

>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, “Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband.”

>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.
